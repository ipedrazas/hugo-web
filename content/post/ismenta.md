Last night we launched [Menta](https://ismenta.com) an online community to help engineers to grow personally and learn. A mixture of events, workshops and mentoring.

One of the first we launched in our slack was a channel to help people write/blog more, and since I like to lead by example, this is my first blog post in aaaaages!

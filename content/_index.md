During my life I have created many blogs, under several domains in different providers. They are all lost now.

How do we guarantee that this one will not follow the previous ones? well, because the 2 sites that did not vanish are hosted in Github: [k8s.uk](http://k8s.uk) and [kubecast.com](https://kubecast.com)

Another important thing to note is that I tend to forget absolutely everything... so, whatever I do, it has to be self-contained.
